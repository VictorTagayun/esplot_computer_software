The software ES Plot has been developed to allow communication between
a microcontroller based electronics and a computer. In particular, in 
applications where the microcontroller is executing a real-time process,
signals can be streamed to a computer in a synchronous way and data can
be sent to the real-time process in an asynchronous way.

ES Plot allows to plot the signals to screen by means of time plots, for
observing their time evolutions, as well as X/Y plots, useful, for example,
for the visualization of characteristics.

It also allows to compute and visualize the FFT of signals in real-time,
allowing the user to choose between amplitude and power spectrum.

Signals can be recorded and exported to Matlab format. Also, recording
can be triggered by the microcontroller application in order to record
precise time windows. 

The communication between microcontroller and computer can happen over
serial communication (USB virtual com port) or over a native USB protocol
relying on the FTDI FT4222 chip.

ES Plot has been designed in order to provide high performance. For this
reason, it needs multi core CPU as well as of a dedicated GPU. Plotting
relies on OpenGL 3.2 and provides the best performance when a dedicated
GPU is available.
